I've been wanting to put some notes down on digital certificates, signing and JWT for some time now.  I find there are plenty of confusing terms involved in this area, plus a few nuances that have added to my personal confusion.  I feel it now important to document these before I forget and move on [to another project].  

So, what's triggered this post?  Well, one of many tasks I'm involved in [juggling] evolves SSO (single sign on).  Albeit, mainly focused on the architecture on this task, I have compiled a few PoCs where I'm using digital certificates for authentication.  In particular, SSOing into Twilio Flex and using an `identity` field returned from their I.AM service, to seamlessly log into our internal CRM, securely using a digital certificate.

# Terms

Ok, let's start with a few terms.  I'll slowly integrate these terms in the following examples.

- Keys

   A key is something that is used to encrypt a piece of data (think JWT payload).  It can be phrase (series of characters) or a public/private key held in a digital certificate.

- Hash

   A hash is a piece of data, that cannot be reengineered to reveal it's original content, also referred to as a digest or one-way hash.

- Encryption

   The process of converting something to gobbledygook and only be able to read it when you have the key used when it was encrypted

- Digital signature

   The encrypted hash, that proves the data has not been tampered with in-flighted AND verifies the identity of the entity presenting it

- Signing

   The process of creating the digital signature

- Base64
   
   The more efficient was of encoding and sending data over a network

- Cipher algorithm

   A cipher algorithm is a mathematical formula designed specifically to obscure the value and content of data. Most valuable cipher algorithms use a key as part of the formula. This key is used to encrypt the data, and either that key or a complementary key is needed to decrypt the data back to a useful form.

- Symmetric Encryption

   Symmetric encryption is a type of encryption where only one key (a secret key) is used to both encrypt and decrypt electronic information

- Asymmetric Encryption

   Asymmetric Encryption is a form of Encryption where keys come in pairs. What one key encrypts, only the other can decrypt

- X.509
   
   Is a standard format for public key certificates. Each X.509 certificate includes a public key, identifying information, and a digital signature.   


Of course, if this [digital signature] is new to you, the above won't (yet) make much sense.

I'm going to walk you through an example, well 2 actually.  One that used a phrase as a key(aka keyphrase), and the other that used a public/private key found in a digital certificate (albeit, self-signed).  I am going to use a tool call `openssl`, not may have heard of it?

# Symmetric encyrption

**_Encryption using a keyphrase_**

In this first example, I'm going to encrypt a message with a `keyphrase`. 

Before I begin, I'm going to write the content of `my secret message` to a file called `msg.txt`. 

Next, I'm going to encrypt this file it using a keyphrase of `abc123` and output the encrypted file to `msg.txt.enc`:

```
$ openssl enc -e -aes256 -k abc123 -in ./msg.txt -out ./msg.txt.enc
```

_above you'll see **-aes256**. This is the cipher algorithm we're using_

The encrypted file looks something like this:
```
Salted__BmFï¿½jÔ¿Å€aï¿½ï¿½1ï¿½ï¿½\X
	ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½{'Vï¿½dFqï¿½&ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Lï¿½8:ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½T
```

Pure gobbledygook!

Now, I'm going to decrypt this encrypted file `msg.txt.enc` and output the encrypted file to `msg.txt.dec`.  It is imperative that I used the same `keyphrase`:

```
$ openssl enc -d -aes256 -k abc123 -in ./msg.txt.enc -out ./msg.txt.dec
```

The decrypted file `msg.txt.dec` looks like:
```
my secret message
```

If I had omitted the `keyphrase`, I will have been prompt for it which will have looked like this:

```
$ openssl enc -d -e -aes256 -in ./msg.txt.enc -out ./msg.txt.dec
enter aes-256-cbc decryption password:
```

Or, if I had used the incorrect `keyphrase, I will have seen something like this:

```
bad decrypt
140120216352064:error:06065064:digital envelope routines:EVP_DecryptFinal_ex:bad decrypt:../crypto/evp/evp_enc.c:583:
```

A good simple illustration of how to encrypt and decrypt a message using `openssl enc` command.

# Asymmetric encryption

**_Encryption using a public/private key_**

In this section I'm going to:
- Generate a RSA private key
- Extract the public key from the private key
- Generate a hash of the data I want to send, as well as signing it (using private key)
- Encrypt the data I want to send
- Decrypt the data I have received
- Verify the signature of the data received - _ensure it data wasn't tampered with in-flight_

Let's first generate the message I want to securely transmit:

```shell
$ echo 'my secret message' > msg
```

## Create a RSA private key

Here I'm using the `genrsa` command.  This command generates an RA private key:

```shell
$ openssl genrsa -out private.pem 4096
```

```shell
$ openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365
```

## Extract public key

```shell
$ openssl rsa -in private.pem -pubout -out public.pem
```

## Generate a digital signature

### using `dgst`

Here, I'm generating a hash (digest) of the message as well as signing it with the private key

```shell
$ openssl dgst -sha256 -sign private.pem -out msg.signature msg
```

### using `rsautl`

`rsautl`, unlike `dgst`, does **not create a hash** or ASN1 encoding. 

{{< hint danger >}}

As `rsautl` uses the RSA algorithm directly, it can only be used to sign, or verify, small pieces of data:  

{{</ hint >}}

```shell
$ openssl rsautl -sign -in msg -inkey private.pem -out msg.sig
```

## Encrypt the message

The `rsautl` command can be used to sign, verify, encrypt and decrypt data using the RSA algorithm.  

```shell
$ openssl rsautl -encrypt -inkey public.pem -pubin -in msg -out msg.enc
```

_By including the `-pubin` switch, you're telling the command that the input key file (`-inkey`) is an RSA public key. Withou this, it assumed you're using a private key_

## Decrypt the message

```shell
$ openssl rsautl -decrypt -inkey private.pem -in msg.enc -out msg.dec
```

## Verify signature 

### using `dgst`

This uses the public key to decrypt the Hash of the original msg:

pseudo logic:
```
hash_1 = Hash ( msg )
hash_2 = Dec ( Key -> Hash )
IsVarified = hash_1 == hash_2
```

```shell
$ openssl dgst -sha256 -verify public.pem -signature msg.signature msg
Verified OK
```

### using `rsautl`

This verifies the original message using the signature and outputs it:

```shell
$ openssl rsautl -verify -inkey private.pem -in msg.sig
my secret message
```

# Digital Certificates

**_To verify the identity of the entity presenting it_**

So far, we've covered hashes, key pairs, digital signatures and encryption and decryption.  This section is where I cover, briefly, digital certificates.  I'm using a digital certificate to replace the key pair as covered above and to give the capability of using additional information to verify that the identity of the entity presenting this message.

Let's start by creating a self-signed certificate. Type:

```shell
# create self-signed certificate 
openssl req -x509 -sha256 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout myserver.pem -out myserver.crt -subj "/C=UK/OU=IT/CN=myserver.com"
```

We can inspect the content of the certificate by typing:
```shell
openssl x509 -in myserver.crt -text -noout
```

For bravity, I'm using the same commands as used above to; extract public key, generate digital signature, encrypt/decrypt then verify the signature.  I've included all the statements in one block:

```shell
# extract public key from self-signed certificate
openssl rsa -in myserver.pem -pubout -out server-public.pem

# generate hash and sign (digital signature)
$ openssl dgst -sha256 -sign myserver.pem -out msg.server-signature msg

# encrypt my message
openssl rsautl -encrypt -inkey server-public.pem -pubin -in msg -out msg.enc2

# decrypt my encrypted message
openssl rsautl -decrypt -inkey myserver.pem -in msg.enc2 -out msg.dec2

# vertify signature
openssl dgst -sha256 -verify server-public.pem -signature msg.server-signature msg
```

This results in:

```
Verified OK
```

So, how does the digital signature relate to the Signature verification against a jwt token?  

A JWT signature is RSA SHA of the header and payload.  This algorithm is set in the header so we have all the information we need to decrypt the encrypted data.  However, we're not able to verify these points yet: (a) has the message been tampered with inflight and (b) the identity of the entity presenting this message.  

In actual fact, you will see this if you copied the a JWT token without keys into jwt.io (selecting RSA256 algorithm).  It will show `Invalid Signature`.  So, to verify these points, you need to provide the public and private key.  It will use the private key to obtain the original Hash (hash of the original data) then decrypt this.  If once decrypted, this equates to the RSASHA246 HMAC, then the signature is verified.
