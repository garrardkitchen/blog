Today I created a simple nodeJS Azure Functions app to start building out a PoC and when I tried to install it's dependencies like so:

```powershell
npm install
```

I got this little cherub back instead:

{{< hint danger >}}

npm ERR! code E401

npm ERR! Incorrect or missing password.

npm ERR! If you were trying to login, change your password, create an

npm ERR! authentication token or enable two-factor authentication then

npm ERR! that means you likely typed your password in incorrectly.

{{</ hint >}}

Ok then, obviously I've set my default registry somewhere to something other than npmjs!

This will not have been an issue or noticeable if I had have been connected to my works VPN as I know for a fact, the upstream sources of our npm Azure DevOps npm feed is in fact `https://registry.npmjs.org`.

Anyhow, to work through this slight annoyance, for this I typed:

```powershell
nodejs install --registry https://registry.npmjs.org
...
npm install --registry https://registry.npmjs.org

added 78 packages, and audited 79 packages in 12s

30 packages are looking for funding
  run `npm fund` for details

found 0 vulnerabilities
```

One `npm run prestart` and one `npm run start` later, I was seeing this:


```

All good, but now I need to change my defaults ...
