# Adding more GitHub Self-Hosted Runners

To help build out our numbers of GitHub Self-Hosted Runner, we took a shortcut and had cloned an existing Linux VM.

Unfortunately, the by-product of doing this resulted in (a) the _clonee_ (source) Linux VM had their Self-Hosted hijacked by the _new_ VM and (b) we had a Runner registered in GitHub that didn't actually have a running runner - `Offline` ðŸ¤ª.

Madness!

Ok, so what to do?...

These are the steps I worked thru to rectify this:
- Firstly, remove Runner off of the new VM
- Next, rerun the `config.sh` step on new VM
- Finally, restart to Runner service on Clonee VM

## First, let's deal with the New VM

First of all, we need to remove the correct Runner service so I ran:

```powershell
sudo systemctl | grep runner
...
sudo systemctl  | grep runner
  actions.runner.<org>.<hostname>.service                                                loaded active 
```

I then copied the above service (`actions.runner.<org>.<hostname>.service`) name into clipboard and past in below (`<service-name>`)

```powershell
systemctl stop <service-name>
systemctl disable <service-name>
```

Next, I returned to the GitHub portal and navigated to the Runners page and selected the new Runner.  What I'm aiming to do here is to get a token that I can use to remove the Runner from the new VM:

I pressed the `Remove` button

then copied and executed this on the new VM:

```powershell
./config.sh remove --token <redacted>
```

I re-ran the `config.sh` by:

```powershell
./config.sh --url https://github.com/<org> --token <redacted>
sudo ./svc.sh install
sudo ./svc.sh start
```

At this point I saw the Self-Hosted Runner return to the GitHub Runners page - Showing as `Idle` and not as `Offline`. 

## Bring the Clonee back online

At this point, I could now longer see the Clonee's hostname in the list of Runners.

I returned to the Clonee VM and ran:

```powershell
cd actions-runners
sudo ./svc.sh start
```

This restarts the Runner as a service.  It then became visible in the GitHub Runners page.
