**WiP**

Several years back, the company that I was working for at the time shifted to AWS, away from Azure.  It was heavily suggested - I was present during that conversation - that it would be in our favour if we "jumped ship" to _their_ platform.  "Their" being "AWS".  I will go into more detail shortly, but long story short, sadly it was not.  In fact, it turned out to be a huge waste of time.  IMO, they should never have suggested.  There were other implementational suggestions made that _they_ really should not have made.  In retrospect, it was totally unjustifiable not to mention unfair for a company of that size [small].  

# My experience

Immediately after the company I worked for decided not to trade anymore [give up] I did look for posts that critiqued their [partner] experience with AWS.  I didn't find any.  So, just us yeah?!  So why was I so interesting in negative reviews?  For starters, I wanted to understand why as a company we didn't succeed.  I hassen to add, it wasn't just about AWS.  I needed to collate all the information to paint a "true" picture.  As an individual, I'm not into fingers pointing or looking to direct blame from myself.  Afterall, do you want to work in an environment that convinently blames others?  I don't.  This is a learnig moment, nothing more.  Can't fix was had happened but you can definitely use it [learnings] going forward.  If it's my or our fault, then sobeit.  Motivations and influences need to be included to adjust the weights of decisions accordingly.

TODO:// 

- didn't need to focus on creating AMI or nested quickstart with their VPC and data streaming templates
- Should have continued to build out our solution on Azure and used data streaming services and/or serverless to sync data across
- essentially little more than a meet and greet service
- time wasted, could have come to market much earlier and generate revenue earlier
- drawn out process. Example of where we had to wait a few weeks as a key person went on leave [with good reason] but noone to fill that gap.  I was delighted for them but inside I was devasted as it meant another delay

  

I've not read any posts or heard of people willing to speak up against AWS, or their drawn out processes and hoops to jump thru.  In my experience, they are not orientated for small/start up business.  They don't go out of their way to help.  From what I've seen, they will ride the waves of your success but will not go beyond making a venue available for you to work with other companies in their partners programme.
