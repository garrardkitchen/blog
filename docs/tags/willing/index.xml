      <description>I recently had a conversation that stirred up some surpressed memories. The conversation was related to moving to a different cloud vendor. That journey didn&amp;rsquo;t work out so well for me and the company I was working for at the time. Sadly, that company stopped trading and I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s that much of a leap to link that journey to the demise of that company. Hopefully, now the title of this post is starting to make more sense?</description>
