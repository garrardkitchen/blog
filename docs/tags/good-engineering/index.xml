      <description>I gave myself some downtime this weekend. The weather was rubbish so unfortunately I couldn&amp;rsquo;t execute some &amp;ldquo;list&amp;rdquo; tasks. Instead, I watched some movies, helped my boys find stuff, build and generally make a mess - ah, the good stuff yeah?! This gave me the necessary space to think about some of the areas of engineering that would have benefited me from knowing &amp;ldquo;at the time&amp;rdquo;. Below is a list of guiding principles, advice and general experience in engineering resulting from this &amp;ldquo;moment of clarify&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>I have written this post as a method to document what I see as the basics, foundations if you will, for good engineering. Undoubtedly if you are a seasoned engineer, you will recognised all of these principles, less so, if you&amp;rsquo;re just starting out.
Most Engineers are fully versed in the foundations of writing quality, efficient, succinct and testable code. As a Principal Engineer, one of my responsibilities is to ensure that these (1) foundations are recognised by the engineers and (2) are adhered to by all engineers.</description>
