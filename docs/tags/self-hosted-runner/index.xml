      <description>In my current role as Head of Cloud Platform, I am leading the technical effort of migrating our entire on-premise real-estate to Azure. Part of this mission, is to upgrade the runtimes of our applications, regardless of their current placement; IIS Web apps, Windows Services and Docker Swarm containers. I say &amp;ldquo;part of this mission&amp;rdquo; as another aspect of this migration is to create a new foundation for our platform - AKS.</description>

      <description>Out of the blue today, my first day back after Christmas break, I got this when running a GH Actions Workflow on one of our Self-Hosted Linux Runners ðŸ˜±:
Got permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket at unix:///var/run/docker.sock: Get &amp;ldquo;http://%2Fvar%2Frun%2Fdocker.sock/v1.24/containers/json&#34;: dial unix /var/run/docker.sock: connect: permission deniedWe have several GitHub Self-Hosted Runners running on Linux and Windows O/S that produce, amongst other artefacts, Linux and Windows images.</description>
