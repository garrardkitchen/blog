      <description>I had a conversation recently and this reminded me of something that happened to me. Hence, why I&amp;rsquo;m writing this Post. The conversation was over moving to a different Cloud provider. Hopefully, this Post&amp;rsquo;s title makes sense now!
Several years back, the company that I was working for at the time shifted to AWS, away from Azure. It was heavily suggested - I was present during that conversation - that it would be in our interest if we &amp;ldquo;jumped ship&amp;rdquo; to their platform.</description>
