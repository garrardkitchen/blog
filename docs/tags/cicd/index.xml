Part of this mission, is to upgrade the runtimes of our applications, regardless of their current placement; IIS Web apps, Windows Services and Docker Swarm containers. I say &amp;ldquo;part of this mission&amp;rdquo; as another aspect of this migration is to create a new foundation for our platform - AKS.</description>
