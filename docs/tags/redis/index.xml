      <description>First look into .NET Aspire TL;DR: See here for why AZD is not yet supported.
I decided to give .NET Aspire a try. I&amp;rsquo;m yet to watch an online tutorial but I did watch its announcement a few months ago. At the time I did think YAGNI.

My code examples can be found here (includes both docker compose &amp;amp; Kubernetes manifests) - https://github.</description>
