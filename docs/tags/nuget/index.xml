      <description>First look into .NET Aspire I decided to give .NET Aspire a try. I&amp;rsquo;m yet to watch an online tutorial but I did watch its announcement a few months ago. At the time I did think YAGNI. For me, it didn&amp;rsquo;t make much sense. Either that, or it just wasn&amp;rsquo;t being explained well enough. Enthusiasm alone isn&amp;rsquo;t enough to promote a new tool. Since then, I’ve seen many tweets. So, over the last month or so, I’ve gradually grasped its raison d’être.</description>

      <description>The context I have implemented a solution that as it&amp;rsquo;s primary objective iterates through a sequence of HTTP Requests and page interactions. With sequencing through these steps regularly it gives the support team the maximum amount of time to react to an outage. This outage can be isolated to this particular service, or can originate from any of it&amp;rsquo;s downstream dependencies.
To help with the automation of these steps, I&amp;rsquo;m using Selenium and in particular, it&amp;rsquo;s headless browser capability in conjunction with ChromeDriver.</description>

      <description>In my current role as Head of Cloud Platform, I am leading the technical effort of migrating our entire on-premise real-estate to Azure. Part of this mission, is to upgrade the runtimes of our applications, regardless of their current placement; IIS Web apps, Windows Services and Docker Swarm containers. I say &amp;ldquo;part of this mission&amp;rdquo; as another aspect of this migration is to create a new foundation for our platform - AKS.</description>
