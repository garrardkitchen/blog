      <description>Adding more GitHub Self-Hosted Runners To help build out our numbers of GitHub Self-Hosted Runner, we took a shortcut and had cloned an existing Linux VM.
Unfortunately, the by-product of doing this resulted in (a) the clonee (source) Linux VM had their Self-Hosted hijacked by the new VM and (b) we had a Runner registered in GitHub that didn&amp;rsquo;t actually have a running runner - Offline ðŸ¤ª.
Madness!
Ok, so what to do?</description>
