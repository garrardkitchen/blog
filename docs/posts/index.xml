      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been researching into Apache Ignite. With using .NET Core, I have run into one or two challenges that I have had to work through. One of which involves the Agent. You use the Agent when you want to execute queries, SQL DML &amp;amp; DDL amongst other actions, from within the Web Console app. The Agent acts as a proxy. The Agent must connect to both the Web Console and your Server node or Thick Client node.</description>

      <description>With not wanting to have hard coded values pushed to a project&amp;rsquo;s code repository, and an antiquated way to derive Azure Service Principal credentials, I set about exploring ways on accomplishing this with this in mind using Terraform.
Attempt 1 Here ins my first attempt, I load all permutations into map variables. I use an environment variable as an indexer to the appropriate map value:
provider &amp;#34;azurerm&amp;#34; { version = &amp;#34;=2.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to put some notes down on digital certificates, signing and JWT for some time now. I find there are plenty of confusing terms involved in this area, plus a few nuances that have added to my personal confusion. I feel it now important to document these before I forget and move on [to another project].
So, what&amp;rsquo;s triggered this post? Well, one of many tasks I&amp;rsquo;m involved in [juggling] evolves SSO (single sign on).</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;d just ran npm run test in a newly created package I&amp;rsquo;d added to a monorepo (lerna) I&amp;rsquo;d created for a project I was working on that integrates with Twilio Sync, RabbitMQ, Twilio TaskRouter and MSSQL, and I go this:

      <description>This post is a reminder to me of what needs to be installed in order for a pod, created from a local image, that is to be served up via a kubernetes cluster, to be run from your local development environment.
What is Kubernetes and why is it so important? &amp;ldquo;Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation. It has a large, rapidly growing ecosystem.</description>

      <title>How do I mentor?</title>

      <description>I have written this post to document my experiences of mentoring. I have mentored front-end engineers, back-end engineers and UX designers. I have had the pleasure of helping others as well as learning one of two things about myself along this journey too. If ever you get the opportunity to be a mentor, I recommend you jump at the opportunity. It is a self-rewarding experience.
So, what is mentoring?&amp;hellip;
The definition of Mentoring is the act of advising or training (someone, especially a younger colleague).</description>

      <title>Good Engineering - Principles</title>
      <link>http://blog.garrardkitchen.com/posts/principles/</link>

      <description>I have written this post as a method to document what I see as the basics, foundations if you will, for good engineering. Undoubtedly if you are a seasoned engineer, you will recognised all of these principles, less so, if you&amp;rsquo;re just starting out.
Most Engineers are fully versed in the foundations of writing quality, efficient, succinct and testable code. As a Principal Engineer, one of my responsibilities is to ensure that these (1) foundations are recognised by the engineers and (2) are adhered to by all engineers.</description>
